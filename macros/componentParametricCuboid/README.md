This macro creates a "topologically safe" parametric cuboid. It was made in part using the macro recorder, and is intended to be excecuted from the FreeCAD start page. The resulting cuboid is made by padding a sketch. Parameters are in the spreadsheet "var". The default parameters are set to 1in by conversion of 25.4mm/in.
