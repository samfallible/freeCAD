This macro creates a parametric cuboid. It was made in part using the macro recorder, and is intended to be excecuted from the FreeCAD start page. The resulting cuboid is made by padding a sketch. Parameters are in the spreadsheet "var". The default parameters are set to 1in by conversion of 25.4mm/in.

Copy the macro under %AppData%\Roaming\FreeCAD\Macro\ on windows, or the FreeCAD macro editor GUI. Your path may vary.
